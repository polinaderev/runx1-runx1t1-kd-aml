Code for the manuscript on the bidirectional differentiation of t(8;21) AML upon RUNX1::RUNX1T1 depletion. We'll put a link to the paper here once we have at least the preprint online.

Processed files that this code uses and/or produces (FSC files for flow cytometry, bedgraph files for ATACseq, counts for bulk RNAseq, Seurat objects for scRNAseq) are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14578307.
